# Quarto template for ICCR 2024

This template can be used to write an abstract for ICCR 2024 using [Quarto].

> [!NOTE]
> This is **NOT** an official template from the organizers of ICCR 2024. I have merely forked [their official repository](https://github.com/tbaudier/iccr2024_templates) and tried to make a quarto template from it.


[Quarto]: https://quarto.org


## Using the Template

To start writing an abstract with this template, use the following command

```
quarto use rmnldwg/quaro-iccr
```

which will create a new project based off of this template.
