# Materials and Methods

This is how you add one [@Pivot2023] or multiple citations [@Saporta2022;@Robert2022].

And this is a dummy equation
$$
I_\alpha = \int_0^\alpha f(x) dx
$$ {#eq-dummy}

![This is a dummy figure to be replaced.](fig1.pdf){#fig-dummy fig-env="figure*"}

@fig-dummy shows how to include a figure.
@tbl-dummy shows how to include a table.
